Question One
-z will return true if the string has a length of Zero.

Question Two
Without quotation marks around $1, $1 would act as a parameter

Question Three
It is useful to use exit codes in Unix because it supplies important
information to the calling function. For example if an error was to occur
the flow of operations may change.

Question Four
The util_is_avail function checks if a utility is available on the system.
Returning $1 is it is not available on the system and $2 for the utility name.
The benefit of writing it would be that the script would check to see which
utilities are needed before going through with any executions that would
require said utilities.

Question Five
A temporary file name is stored in the variable TMP_FILE_R.

Question Six
It is important to execute rm -f $TMP_FILE_R under all circumstance because it
is a temporary file that has served its purpose.

Question Seven
The roff2pdf function is called passing OUTPUT_TITLE to the function. A new
file will be created with the name stored in OUTPUT_TITLE with the suffix .PDF.

Question Eight
Redirects strderr to a null device that take any input and discards it.

Question Nine
$? returns the exit code of the last command. RETVAL holds that value.
Zero indicated a proper execution and exit. any other code indicates an error
or another return. When using [ $RETVAL -ne 0 ] we are checking is the value
of RETVAL is not equal to 0, if it not equal to 0, meaning if an error did
occur in the previous statement then execute the following commands. In the
case of line 64, ps2pdf converts the specified file into a pdf. RETVAL will
then take the exit code from that statement and exit the roff2pdf function
retuning the appropriate exit code.
