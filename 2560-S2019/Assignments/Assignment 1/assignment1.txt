(Q1)    What does -z do if it appears as the first non-whitespace token within
        square brackets? (Hint: read the man page for test.)
                                                                    [1 mark]

(Q2)    What might go wrong if one does not use quotes around the "$1" in the
        first if statement? Explain and give a complete brief example. (Hint:
        write a very short script and try out some inputs.)
                                                                    [2 marks]

(Q3)    In the first if statement, exit 1 is used. What is the benefit of
        using exit values from scripts/programs in UNIX?
                                                                    [1 mark]

(Q4)    What does the util_is_avail() function do? What is the benefit of
        writing it? (Hint: consider what the script would look like to have
        the same functionality without it.)
                                                                    [4 marks]

(Q5)    In the roff2pdf() function, explain what is stored in the TMP_FILE_R
        variable. (Hint: read the man page for the substituted command.)
                                                                    [2 marks]

(Q6)    In the roff2pdf() function, why is it important to execute rm -f
        $TMP_FILE_R at the end of the function under all circumstances?
                                                                    [2 marks]

(Q7)    Explain everything that is happening on line 125 of the script, where
        the roff2pdf() function is called. (Hint: sort out the function
        arguments and input/output redirection.)
                                                                    [4 marks]

(Q8)    Some of the external commands have 2>/dev/null after them (e.g. lines
        50, 53, and 117). What does this do and why is it useful in a shell
        script? (Hints: 2 is a file descriptor, and null has a man page.)
                                                                    [2 marks]

(Q9)    After certain commands/functions are run, the script sets RETVAL=$?
        and then checks if [ $RETVAL -ne 0 ] (e.g. lines 57, 64, 118, and
        126). Explain what gets stored in RETVAL (use one of the cases in the
        script as an example), and explain the purpose of the if statement.
                                                                    [4 marks]
