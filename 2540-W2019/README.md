# 2540-W2019
Data Structures and Algorithms

Winter 2019

"An introduction to the programming and analysis of linear and non-linear internal (main storage) data structures and
associated algorithms. Topics include the formal notion of an algorithm, elementary time and space complexity; linear
lists (such as stacks, queues, linked structures.); non-linear lists (trees, binary trees); recursion; sorting techniques
(such as heap sort, quick sort, merge sort, shell sort.); searching techniques (such as binary search, binary search trees,
red-black trees, hashing.); algorithm design paradigms (such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms);
and applications."(Via course outline)
