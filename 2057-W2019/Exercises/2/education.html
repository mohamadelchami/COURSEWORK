    <br><br>

    <p>
    I am currently in my 4<sup>th</sup> year of post-secondary, currently doing the 2<sup>nd</sup> year in computer sciecne.
    Previously I was enrolled at St.Clair College for graphic design. I decided to switch into a field where I would experience
    more of a intellectual challenge. I graduated from Vincent Massey Secondary School.
