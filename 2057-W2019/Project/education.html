          I am currently in my 4<sup>th</sup> year of post-secondary, currently doing the 2<sup>nd</sup> year in computer science.
          Previously I was enrolled at St.Clair College for graphic design. I decided to switch into a field where I would experience
          more of an intellectual challenge. I graduated from Vincent Massey Secondary School.
