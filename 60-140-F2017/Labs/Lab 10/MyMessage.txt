University of Windsor - My experience at the University of Windsor has been an overall great experience.
It was very easy to adjust to the campus lifestyle as the community is very welcoming.
One aspect that I particularly enjoy in the old architecture in the older buildings, manly the exterior of Dillon and the “new” building under interior construction on huron.

Computer Science Program - The computer science program is very challenging, within reason.
I find myself challenged intellectually on a daily basis which I think is a healthy part of education.
The wide variety of classes within the program creates a diverse curriculum while still maintaining the overall focus on computer science.

03-60-140 - I find this course challenging, but as mentioned before, in a constructive manner.
I struggle with the more advanced concepts, however, it not something that I cannot overcome.
I find this class to be rewarding in term of my work.
he rewarding feeling you get when completing a functioning program after working hard on it is something that never really fails to amaze me.
