Fall 2017

"This course is the first of a two-course sequence designed to introduce students to algorithm design and programming in a high-level language such as C. The main objectives of the course are to develop the ability to identify, understand and design solutions to a wide variety of problems. Topics include: computer system overview, hardware and software, problem solving steps, concepts of variables, constants, data types, algorithmic structure, sequential logic, de- cisions, loops, modular programming, one-dimensional arrays, text files. If possible, problems like searching/sorting will be addressed." (Via Course outline)
